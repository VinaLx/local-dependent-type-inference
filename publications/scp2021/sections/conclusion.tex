\section{Conclusion}

In this article, we come up with a design of a dependently-typed calculus called \name.
\name generalizes non-dependent polymorphic subtyping by Odersky and
L\"aufer~\cite{odersky1996putting} and contains other features like general
recursion and explicit casts for type-level computations.
We adopt the techniques of the Unified Subtyping~\cite{yang2017unifying} to
avoid the mutual dependency between typing and subtyping relation to simplify
the formalization. Besides other relevant theorems about typing and subtyping,
\emph{transitivity} and \emph{type safety} are proved mechanically with the Coq
proof assistant.

In the future, we will attempt to lift various restrictions that originally simplify
the metatheory, such as the kind restriction of polymorphic
types and the runtime irrelevance of implicit arguments. Also we would like to
study the impact to the metatheory of adding $\top$ types to our language,
which is a common feature of a subtyping relation.
Most importantly, we consider the development
of a well-specified algorithmic system a major challenge in our future
work. The current formulation of \name is declarative due to the mono-expression guesses.
